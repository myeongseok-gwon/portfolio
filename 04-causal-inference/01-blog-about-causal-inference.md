:header: **Problem**
1. Complex causal inference code needs simplification
2. Missing proofs and explanations in textbooks (CausalML book)
3. Limited Korean resources for causal inference
4. Time constraints for blog writing and maintaining development state alignment

:header: **Solution**
1. **Code**: Simplified and optimized causal inference implementations
2. **Content**: Added missing proofs and comprehensive documentation
3. **Localization**: Created Korean translations and bilingual guides
4. **Workflow**: Utilized MyST to directly publish ipynb and md files as blog posts
